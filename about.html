        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a digital artist with a background in environmental design. I specialize in pixel art, digital illustration and animation, and I love working on a variety of creative projects. My work is inspired by nature, storytelling, and a deep appreciation for vibrant colors and detail. I have a passion for creating engaging art that tells a story, whether it's a single character or a whole world.</p>
        
        <h3>Resume</h3>
        <p>I have a diverse range of experience in both the digital art and design industries, including freelance work and personal projects. I have worked as a content manager and freelance artist on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, creating pixel art, illustrations, and animations. Additionally, I have a background in environmental design and am continuously expanding my skills in web design.</p>
        
        <h3>Selected Clients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Freelance Projects on Upwork and Fiverr</li>
          <li>Various collaborations and commissions</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>My Work Process</h3>
        <p>Each project begins with understanding the client's vision and needs. I collaborate closely with clients, ensuring their ideas are reflected in the final product. Whether it's creating pixel art or designing a website, I always aim for clean, professional, and visually appealing results. I use tools like Adobe Photoshop, 3ds Max, and other digital design software to bring my concepts to life.</p>

        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>When I'm not working on creative projects, I enjoy painting, going for walks in nature, and exploring new art styles. I'm a big fan of strategy games and love the challenge they provide. Additionally, I continue learning languages and discovering new creative techniques. I'm also vegan, and I enjoy experimenting with plant-based recipes in my free time.</p>
